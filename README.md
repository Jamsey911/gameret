## Business Plan  
### Executive Summary:

Gameret is a web-based platform that video game lovers can view and purchase old and new products in the video game industry. It offers a convenient ecommerce shop with a easy-to-use platform for purchasing products as well as a contact page for inquiries and support.

Our target market is video game lovers of all ages. We aim to differentiate ourselves from competitors by offering a more easy to use and intuitive platform, as well varied scale of products.

Overall, Gameret aims to become the go-to destination for gamers looking to purchase video game products, as well as a trusted and reliable platform to use.

### Market Analysis:

The gaming industry is a multi-billion euro industry, with a large and dedicated consumer base. While traditional methods of purchasing video game related items (such as travelling to shop to see what is offered in-person) are still popular, there is a growing trend towards online ecommerce platforms. This shift towards online ecommerce presents a significant opportunity for Gameret to establish itself as a leading player in the market.

In terms of competition, Gameret will face other online ecommerce platforms as well as traditional methods of purchasing. However, we believe that our user-friendly platform and wide range of products in our ecommerce shop will differentiate us from competitors and make us a preferred choice for gamers.

In terms of target market, our primary focus will be video game lovers of all ages. We will also target collectors and online groups as potential customers for our software, as these organizations are constantly seeking rare and collectable pieces.

### Marketing and Sales Strategy:

Gameret will utilize a combination of online and offline marketing tactics to reach our target market. These tactics will include:

Online advertising through Google AdWords and social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram
Content marketing through our blog and email newsletter
Partnerships and sponsorships with video-game related brands
Public relations efforts to generate press coverage and raise awareness of Gameret


### Operations and Management:

Gameret will be operated and managed by a small team of experienced professionals. The team will consist of a CEO, CTO, and marketing and sales staff.

In terms of operations, we will utilize a cloud-based platform to host the website and software, as well as a payment gateway for processing transactions. We will also utilize third-party fulfillment centers to handle the storage, packing, and shipping of products purchased through our ecommerce shop.

#### Financial Plan:

Gameret will generate revenue through the sale of products in our ecommerce shop. In terms of expenses, the main cost will be marketing and advertising efforts to drive traffic to the website and attract customers. We will also incur expenses related to the development.

In terms of financing, Gameret will initially be funded through a combination of personal investment and a small seed round of funding. As the business grows, we will explore additional funding options such as venture capital or a larger round of financing.

In terms of projections, we anticipate strong growth in revenue streams over the first few years of operation. In the first year, we expect to generate â‚¬100,000 in revenue coming from product sales. In the second year, we expect to see revenue increase to â‚¬200,000 coming from product sales. By the third year, we anticipate revenue to reach â‚¬300,000 coming from software sales.

In terms of profitability, we expect to break even within the first year of operation and achieve profitability in the second year.

### Conclusion:

Gameret is a unique and innovative platform that aims to connect gamers with new and rare items, while also offering a convenient and user-friendly platform for purchasing video game related products. With strong growth potential and a clear revenue model, we believe that Gameret has the potential to become a leading player in the gaming industry.

## Wireframes
I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for my project. It's a user-friendly wireframing tool that enables me to quickly and easily create mockups for my website or application. It offers a wide range of pre-built UI elements, and allows for easy collaboration with my team. I linked a pdf of my wireframes, which you can access it and check it out the design, layout and the flow of the project before implementing it in the real product.

## AWS 

AWS (Amazon Web Services) was utilized in this project for hosting image files. An S3 bucket on AWS was created to store and serve the project's images, providing a reliable and scalable solution for managing and delivering the visual assets. With AWS, the project benefits from secure and efficient storage capabilities, ensuring seamless access to images throughout the application.

## Features  


### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
I have used meta tags in the HTML of my web app's pages to optimize them for search engines. The description tag provides a brief summary of the content on the page, while the keywords tag lists relevant keywords to help search engines understand the content of the webpage and its relevance to related search queries.
